Dear Saqlain,

 

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to provide you with some constructive feedback on your recent assignment and offer guidance on formatting and referencing.

 

Firstly, it is important to address the issue of referencing in your assignment. You should incorporate the Harvard referencing system to properly cite your sources throughout the document. Ensure that all sources are appropriately cited in both the in-text citations and the reference list.

 

Additionally, I have noticed that the formatting of your assignment is currently making it appear confusing to readers. To improve the overall presentation of your work, please adhere to the following formatting guidelines:

 

Main Heading: Utilize the Times New Roman font, set it to Bold, and adjust the font size to 14 for your main headings.
Subheading: For subheadings, maintain the Times New Roman font, make it Bold, and set the font size to 13.
Paragraphs: Keep a consistent font style of Times New Roman with a font size of 12 for your paragraphs.
Line Spacing: Set the line spacing to 1.5 throughout the entire document.
Page Start: Begin your assignment on a separate page to create a more professional presentation.
Add an Index: Include an index to assist readers in navigating your assignment effectively.
 

Furthermore, I have noted that your referencing is reasonable for this level of study, but it is advisable to incorporate more in-text citations. In-text citations are essential to support your arguments and statements with relevant sources within the body of the assignment.

 

Lastly, while your list of references appears extensive, not all of these references have been cited within the paragraphs of your assignment body. Please make sure that all referenced sources are properly integrated into the text.

 

I trust that these suggestions will assist you in enhancing the quality and clarity of your assignments. Should you require any further guidance or have any questions regarding the points mentioned above, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

 

Best Wishes,
